        <h1>Meet Katherine</h1>
        <p class="about-text">
          Fitness has always been a part of Katherine’s life, starting from an early age.  She started swimming before she could barely walk and had her first gym membership by the time she was 11 years old. She played many sports growing up, but found a true love in dance. Despite being always physically active, Katherine struggled with weight through high school. She found the secret to a healthy weight and body image is through a healthy lifestyle that consists of balance. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Over 10 years of ballet, jazz and various styles of dance training, and 8 years of yoga practice, has helped Katherine refine body movement, flow and form. 
          Having recovered from many injuries herself, she understands the importance of proper alignment and building full body strength from the largest muscles to the tiniest. She has experience working with a diverse array of clients to help them 
          reach their goals, from losing weight to improving athletic ability. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          She focuses on pushing the limits of the human body, while maintaining proper form and execution of the exercises. She believes that your attitude in 
          the gym and the effort your put into your workouts will transfer over into how you live your life. Katherine uses her passions for fitness to inspire and motivate her clients and to help them transform their bodies, as well as their overall well-being. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Katherine has a tendency to take on everything she does with full force; she picked up running a few years ago and hasn’t stopped since. She finds sanity in this crazy city through distance running. She challenges anyone who says they “hate running,” or “can’t run,” to give her a chance to transform their thinking.
