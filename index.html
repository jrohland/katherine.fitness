      <h5>Owner, Certified Personal Trainer &amp; Acupuncturist in training</h5>
​
      <p>Hi, I’m Katherine! Thank you for stopping by. I am a <strong>NASM certified personal trainer</strong>, avid runner and yogi. I am currently studying Acupuncture and expanding my knowledge of physical and mental healing, combing both Western and Eastern philosophies. I believe in a holistic wellness approach that combines <strong>nourishing the body, mind and soul.</strong></p>

      <p>My goal is to <strong>help you achieve your best</strong> and <strong>learn to love your body</strong> for all the strength, agility, flexibility and beauty it holds. I believe your attitude in the gym and the effort you put forth in your workouts transfers over into how you live your life. I use my passion for fitness to <strong>inspire and motivate</strong> my clients to help them transform their bodies, as well as their overall well-being.</p>

      <p>As no two people are the same, I create completely customized fitness &amp; health programs that combine multiple modalities to fit your individual needs. As I believe that on-going support and communication is vital for success, I am <strong>committed to my clients</strong> and always on hand.</p>

          <h5>The Body Achieves What the Mind Believes</h5>

          <p>I train clients in their homes, home gyms, or outdoors throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn. I utilize a dynamic integrated training style that will always keep you on your toes (no pun intended!). My specialties include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>TRX</li>
            <li>Kettlebells</li>
            <li>HIIT training</li>
            <li>Yoga</li>
            <li>Pilates</li>
            <li>Weight-loss</li>
            <li>Pre/Post-Natal</li>
            <li>Injury prevention for athletes</li>
            <li>Injury recovery</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Physical fitness should be challenging and FUN. My mission is not only to help my clients improve their fitness level, but also to educate them, so that the changes we make together can be maintained throughout a lifetime.</p>

          <p>I wouldn't expect you to commit to a pair of pants without trying them on, I don't expect you to commit to me without a test ride first. That's why I offer a free in-person consult and evaluation, which usually takes about 45min.</p>
